                                        As you might know, a responsive website is the one that can change in accordance
                                        with fit and look of every single receptive gadget. It isn't important to have a
                                        few websites, one for desktop computers and another for mobile devices. It is
                                        troublesome overseeing them independently. What’s more? It requires a great deal
                                        of money and time. Along these lines, it is critical to switch to responsive web
                                        design. As a marketer, your true objective should be to offer a delightful
                                        customer experience. A responsive website helps you do precisely the same.
                                        Browsing a responsive website gives a superior user experience than the website
                                        optimized primarily for desktop computers. What’s more? This is an
                                        unquestionable requirement from the SEO point of view too.

                                        Google recommends responsive design. Not just do the responsive websites ensure
                                        a superior customer experience, they enhance your search rankings as well. Most
                                        websites today are getting 70%+ traffic from mobile users. Thus, your
                                        development approach ought to be 'Mobile First'. Are you prepared to cater to
                                        this vast traffic coming to your website from mobile devices? On the off chance
                                        that you have a relatively older website and it's not responsive, do act now.
                                        Auctech has optimized numerous websites for mobile devices. Furthermore, it has
                                        created hundreds of new websites with 'mobile first' approach in the last four

                                            customer satisfaction and loyalty by improving the usability, ease of use,

                                        than a mobile-friendly website. One of the greatest advantages of having a
                                        mobile app is that all the information you'd like to offer to your customers–
                                        including special deals and promotions – is at their fingertips. Through pop-up
                                        messages or push notifications, you're getting to do direct interactions with
                                        your customers, and can easily remind them about your products and services
                                        whenever it makes sense. A mobile app for your business can extraordinarily add
                                        to your brand awareness.

                                            An increasing number of consumers prefer making most of their purchases

                                            business is important. Although your own e-commerce website would certainly

                                            such as amazon or ebay, having your own e-commerce website has several
                                            advantages. Although amazon or ebay can give you access to an unprecedented
                                            level of traffic, the fact remains that you fight with several brands on
                                            these platforms. Businesses understand the need to have their own branded
                                            website but they are scared off by the prospect of having to generate their

                                            The truth is that getting your e-commerce website up to the speed is a
                                            longer-term project than selling on Amazon but the rewards of owning your
                                            own platforms cannot be underestimated. In the long run, you need to think
                                            about building up your brand and creating an e-commerce business that is
